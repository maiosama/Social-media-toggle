## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference
